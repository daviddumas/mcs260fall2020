    "Imagine you are writing a program that will distribute a limited resource, such as access to computers to perform calculations.  You must make sure that you don't overcommit the resource.\n",

    "Create something like this as follows.\n",

    "First, make a global list variable `tickets` that contains 10 integers.  Choose these integers yourself, using any method you like.  Just make sure they are all different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, write a function `get_ticket()` that, when called, will remove and return an integer from `tickets`, if the list is nonempty.  But if the list is empty, your function should raise `Exception(\"No tickets available\")`\n",
